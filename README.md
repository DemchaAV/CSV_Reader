This API from the beginning was created with a porpoise to transfer data from ReversoContext bookmarks and reformatting them to the application reword. 
This API works with CSV format  One of the main classes can do with multithreads to reduce a processing time, for the original task. Also the project contains way to create a table, where you can edit the table,
with additional methods as like add columns, pick a line, delete a cell, set a quote, sort a columns with natural order, or use class Comparable, etc. In a plan to create an application with editor, 
for CSV from GUI to add simple table editing and output functions. The main task for me also been to create a clear code, organize everything and work on the errors of code construction in previous projects, its flexibility.
